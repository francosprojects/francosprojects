Hi this is Franco Perinotti's github page. Here I list all my projects through school and independent creation. 
Feel free to contact me at ftperinotti@gmail.com if you would like to hear more about them.

francosprojects/francosprojects is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
